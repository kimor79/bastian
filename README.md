The Hardest Problem of Computer Science
=======================================

It's a story that never ends. An instance launches and to prevent it from succumbing to

Bastian is comprised of two parts:

  1. Set the local hostname based on tags.
  1. Add a DNS entry in Route53 for the hostname pointing to the IP for VPCs or the
     ec2-<ip> hostname for EC2-Classic.
